                 critical step in the process is identifying resistance values
                 for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding
                 impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be
                 parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of
                 such information, expert-opinion is often used. However, the
                 use of expert-opinion is seen as subjective, human-centric and
                 unreliable. This study derived resistance values from grey

                 of squirrel occurrence within each land cover type were
                 inverted, providing resistance values which were used to
                 parameterise a least-cost model. The resulting habitat

               and spatial configuration influence assessments of habitat

               three landcover types ranked consistently from low to high
               quality: inhospitable matrix, hospitable matrix, and habitat. We
               controlled the area and degree of fragmentation of each
               landcover in a factorial experiment for a total of 20
               combinations replicated 100 times. In each landscape we compared
               eight sets of relative landcover qualities (cost values of 1 for
               habitat, between 1.5 and 150 for hospitable matrix, and
               3--10,000 for inhospitable matrix). We found that the spatial
               location of least-cost routes was sensitive to differences in
               relative cost values assigned to landcover types and that the
               degree of sensitivity depended on the spatial structure of the
               landscape. Highest sensitivity was found in landscapes with
               fragmented habitat and between 20 and 50\% hospitable matrix;
               sensitivity decreased as habitat fragmentation decreased and the
               amount of hospitable matrix increased. As a means of coping with
               this sensitivity, we propose identifying multiple low-cost
               routes between pairs of habitat patches that collectively
               delineate probable movement zones. These probable movement zones

                 overlooked property of this potential connectivity is that it
                 may change with time. In the marine realm, transient landscape
                 features, such as mesoscale eddies and alongshore jets,
                 produce potential connectivity that is highly variable in

                 comparing simulations of nearshore metapopulation dynamics
                 when potential connectivity is constant through time (i.e.,
                 when it is deterministic) and when it varies in time (i.e.,
                 when it is stochastic). We use mathematical analysis to reach
                 general conclusions and realistic biophysical modeling to
                 determine the actual magnitude of these changes for a specific

                 metapopulation growth rates when the species is rare and
                 equilibrium abundances. Our biophysical models reveal that
                 stochastic outcomes are almost always lower than their
                 deterministic counterparts, sometimes by up to 40\%. This has

              in their propensity to move within and between MPAs is therefore
              a key consideration for multi-species MPA network design. Here,
              we propose a conceptual framework to incorporate ecological
              processes that affect movement at multiple life stages into the
              MPA network design process. We illustrate how our framework can
              be implemented using a set of hypothetical species that represent
              regional trait diversity in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We
              focused on two ecological processes: (1) dispersal during the
              larval phase and (2) daily home range movement during the adult
              phase. To identify functional connectivity patterns, we used a
              biophysical model to simulate larval dispersal, and then
              prioritized highly-connected patches using a reserve selection
              algorithm. To ensure that individual reserves were commensurate
              with home ranges, we also imposed reserve size constraints.
              Candidate areas for protection were identified based on
              multi-species connectivity patterns and home range size
              constraints. Collectively, this conceptual framework offers a
              flexible approach to multi-species, cross-life stage conservation
              planning, which can be further adapted to address complex life
              histories. As marine conservation efforts around the globe aim to
              design ecologically connected networks of protected areas, the
              integration of movement and connectivity data throughout ontogeny

              the land and in the sea. However, standard approaches for
              prioritizing locations for marine and terrestrial reserves
              neglect to consider connections between ecosystems. We
              demonstrate an integrated approach for coral reef conservation
              with the objective of prioritizing marine reserves close to
              catchments with high forest cover in order to facilitate
              ecological processes that rely upon intact land--sea protected
              area connections and minimize negative impact of land-based
              runoff on coral reefs. Our aims are to (1) develop and apply
              simple models of connections between ecosystems that require
              little data and (2) incorporate different types of connectivity
              models into spatial conservation prioritization. We compared how,
              if at all, the locations and attributes (e.g., costs) of
              priorities differ from an approach that ignores connections. We
              analyzed spatial prioritization plans that allow for no
              connectivity, adjacent connectivity in the sea, symmetric and
              asymmetric land--sea connectivity, and the combination of
              adjacent connectivity in the sea and asymmetric land--sea
              connectivity. The overall reserve system costs were similar for
              all scenarios. We discovered that integrated planning delivered
              substantially different spatial priorities compared to the
              approach that ignored connections. Only 11--40\% of sites that
              were high priority for conservation were similar between
              scenarios with and without connectivity. Many coral reefs that
              were a high priority when we considered adjacent connectivity in
              the sea and ignored land--sea connectivity were assigned to low
              priorities when symmetric land--sea connectivity was included,

               conservation planning of fresh waters",
  author    = "Hermoso, V and Linke, S and Prenda, J and Possingham, H P",
  abstract  = "1. Freshwater conservation has received less attention than its
               terrestrial or marine counterparts. Given the accelerated rate
               of change and intensive human use that freshwater ecosystems are
               submitted to, it is urgent to focus more attention on fresh
               waters. Existing conservation planning tools -- such as Marxan
               -- need to be modified to account for the special nature of
               these systems. Connectivity plays a key role in freshwater
               ecosystems. Threats are mediated along river corridors, and the
               condition of the entire catchment influences river biodiversity
               downstream. This needs to be considered in conservation
               planning. 2. The probabilities of occurrence of nine native
               freshwater fish species in a Mediterranean river basin, obtained
               from Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines- Generalized
               Linear Model (MARS-GLM) models, were used as features to develop
               spatial conservation priorities. The priorities accounted for
               complementarity and spatial design issues. 3. To deal with the
               connected nature of rivers, we modified Marxan’s boundary length
               penalty, avoiding the selection of isolated planning units and
               forcing the inclusion of closer upstream areas. We introduced
               ‘virtual boundaries’ between non-headwater stream segments and
               added distance-weighted penalties to the overall connectivity
               cost (CP) when stream segments upstream of the selected planning
               units are not selected. 4. This approach to prioritising
               connectivity is concordant with ecological theory, as it
               considers the natural and roughly exponential decay of upstream
               influences with distance. It accounts for the natural capacity
               of rivers to mitigate impacts when designing reserves. When
               connectivity was not emphasised, Marxan prioritised natural
               corridors for longitudinal movements. In contrast, whole
               sub-basins were prioritised when connectivity was emphasised.
               Changing the relative emphasis on connectivity substantially
               changed the spatial prioritisation; our conservation investment
               could move from one basin to another. 5. Our novel approach to
               dealing with directional connectivity enables managers of
               freshwater systems to set ecologically meaningful spatial

  abstract  = "Real patterns of ecological connectivity are seldom explicitly
               or systematically accounted for systematic conservation
               planning, in part because commonly used decision support systems
               can only capture simplistic notions of connectivity.
               Conventionally, the surrogates used to represent connectivity in
               conservation plans have assumed the connection between two sites
               to be symmetric in strength. In reality, ecological linkages
               between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly
               asymmetric. Here, we develop a novel formulation that enabled us
               to incorporate asymmetric connectivity into the conservation
               decision support system Marxan. We illustrate this approach
               using hypothetical examples of a river catchment and a group of
               reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River
               catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that
               incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic
               reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture
               connectivity patterns, relative to either ignoring connectivity
               or assuming symmetric connectivity.",

  abstract    = "Spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) are often
                 considered the best way to predict and manage species
                 distributions in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. However,
                 they are computationally intensive and require extensive
                 knowledge of species' biology and behavior, limiting their
                 application in many cases. An alternative to SEPMs is graph
                 theory, which has minimal data requirements and efficient
                 algorithms. Although only recently introduced to landscape
                 ecology, graph theory is well suited to ecological
                 applications concerned with connectivity or movement. This
                 paper compares the performance of graph theory to a SEPM in
                 selecting important habitat patches for Wood Thrush
                 (Hylocichla mustelina) conservation. We use both models to
                 identify habitat patches that act as population sources and
                 persistent patches and also use graph theory to identify
                 patches that act as stepping stones for dispersal.
                 Correlations of patch rankings were very high between the two
                 models. In addition, graph theory offers the ability to
                 identify patches that are very important to habitat
                 connectivity and thus long-term population persistence across
                 the landscape. We show that graph theory makes very similar
                 predictions in most cases and in other cases offers insight
                 not available from the SEPM, and we conclude that graph theory
                 is a suitable and possibly preferable alternative to SEPMs for
                 species conservation in heterogeneous landscapes.",
